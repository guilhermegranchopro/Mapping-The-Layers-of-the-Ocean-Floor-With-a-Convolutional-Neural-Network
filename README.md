## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks, to segment and analyze images of the ocean floor. This allows for the identification and mapping of different geological layers. The methodology involves several stages, including image preprocessing, model training for segmentation, and post-processing of the results.

The work is divided into several experimental stages, as detailed in the Jupyter Notebooks within the `EXPA/ML-Segmentation/` directory:

- **Etapa1-Segmentation.ipynb:** Initial image segmentation using a CNN.
- **Etapa2-Kmeans.ipynb:** Application of K-means clustering for further refinement.
- **Etapa3-Watersherd&Tabela.ipynb:** Utilization of watershed algorithms and generation of data tables with morphological parameters.
